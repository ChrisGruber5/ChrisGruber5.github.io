    <h3 style="color:white;">My name is Chris Gruber. I am currently a 21 year old Junior MIS here at the University of Oklahoma. I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma and will
     always have a soft spot for Tulsa. I am a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity as well. I am starting my professional career this summer at OneGas as an Information
    Technology Intern. I am very much looking forward to that!</h3>
